Research Question:
How can HEIs more rigorously assess and plan transportation to leverage the unique **social** and **physical** aspects of campus to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated from campus population trips by encouraging active and alterative travel modes?

## Abstract 
[TRACS Abstract - Blanchard.docx](https://1drv.ms/w/c/d9fa054a718ddf3f/EXBPXWhbOJJDh7F9bC8Yr1cB6aga1eOeD_I_GOHHx21oxg?e=vP5hcl)

Existing literature highlights a critical gap in university travel behavior research, particularly in understanding how Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) can leverage their unique characteristics to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.(Zhou et al., 2018) This study examines travel behavior and mode choice at Texas State University, where students account for over 50% of San Marcos's population and operate at a density of 83.2 students per acre, creating distinct opportunities for transportation intervention. We employ **both Multinomial Logit Model (MNL) or Nested Logit Model (NLM)** to analyze existing transportation data, evaluating how physical campus characteristics including compact design, infrastructure, and connectivity influence mode choice. Demonstrates how travel behavior stems from both physical infrastructure and social factors, including personal norms, attitudes, and travel satisfaction. (De Angelis et al., 2021) The study capitalizes on what identify as the "window of opportunity", a crucial transition period when students show increased likelihood of adopting sustainable travel behaviors.(De Angelis et al., 2021, ) With students generating approximately 20% more daily trips than the general public, we examine how Texas State University can leverage its dense, compact nature and existing multimodal systems to reduce single-occupancy vehicle trips.(Khattak et al., 2011) Our research provides a rigorous assessment framework for HEIs to evaluate and plan transportation systems that effectively reduce emissions while promoting active and alternative travel modes, contributing practical strategies for other college towns seeking to enhance sustainable transportation options.

## Transportation at HEI

HEI Landscape
This study recognizes HEIs as microcosms of urban landscape, examining commuting patterns, barrier, and motivators effecting transportation mode choice at five HEIs in Italy. (De Angelis et al., 2021, pp. 2-4) This study emphasizes the unique contexts HEI provides for travel behavior research due to higher density, alternative transportation-friendly infrastructure, and existing multimodal transportation systems. Travel behavior is determine by both the knowledge of traffic, built environment, and social factors, and psychological aspect. (De Angelis et al., 2021, p. 1)(Khattak et al., 2011, p. 144)  HEI like cities provided housing, medical, food, medical, transportation services to residents, or students, faculty, and staff. HEI are a locations of high density of users inclined to use multimodal transportation systems Campuses behaving like cities making them ideal places to implement and evaluate novel mobility **policies** and **practices**. They can and do play a crucial role providing the contextual and novel basis for adopting new travel behaviors in broader conversation of sustainable transportation. 

### College Campus
**(Zhou, Wang, & Wu, 2018)**
As mentioned in previous literature there is a lack of research focused on university travel and many recent studies focus on campuses in an urban setting.(p.2) This research uses a pilot study bring a specific focus to the popularity of walking and biking among student universities in college towns in the United States.(p. 2) **College towns** are small in population and more compact, of the top 50 college town in the US, the median student population is 33%, with only 3 dipping below 10%.(p.2) The assumption that their smaller population size, local, and existing multimodal systems, give universities the potential leverage their compactness promote more walking and biking friendly. Utilizing Multinomial Logit Model(MNL) and the Nested Logit Model(NLM) this study provides procedures and surveying models for future studies in university travel, in the specific context of car dependent US college towns. (p 2)

There are multiple example (UCLA, Chapel Hill, University of Oregon), with a history of effectively employing TDM to address travel behaviors are good example when looking to promote non-driving-alone trips. Students prioritize affordable housing and proximity to bus stops,  this over lap of land use and travel behavior, helps to better understand how planning transportation on and around campus.(p. 15)  students

### Travel Behavior
##### (De Angelis et al., 2021)
##### Psychosocial
This study strongly suggest more research on psychosocial factors, including **attitude personal norms, personal constrains, and travel satisfaction**. (De Angelis at el., 2021. 6-7)
The author establish Higher Education Institutions (HEI) settings, emphasizing how individual attitudes and perceptions influence transportation choices. The study is grounded in two key theoretical frameworks: the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), which focuses on perceived behavioral control, and the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) theory, which emphasizes personal moral obligations toward environmental protection.(De Angelis et al., 2021, p. 1-2) These frameworks help explain how individuals' combined knowledge and perception of transportation systems shape users attitudes toward different travel mode choices and ultimately determine present and future travel behavior.

#### Window of opportunity 
The transitional time students spend in higher education is a "**window of opportunities**" as individuals are more likely to adopt new life behaviors. This window can also be understood through the concept of "**habit discontinuity**", or the disruption of existing habits creates opportunities for new behaviors. Moving, new job, new additional to the family, and students going to college are opportunities to that challenge receptive and regular behaviors, like travel mode choice behavior. Travel behavior is a action of **habit**, HEI provide a chance for students, new commuters, to experience different modes of transportations can impact not only the way individual commute, but their attitudes and perspective toward various travel modes in the future.(De Angelis et al., 2021, p. 2,11) 

#### Physical
**Location and connectivity** - looking at 5 universities with varying levels of connection to road, rail, and PT. Finding availability and quality of these modes will significantly impact choice. (De Angelis et al., 2021, p. 4)
**Transport infrastructure and services** -  campus infrastructure should support and encourage multi modal travel. Safe bike lanes, connectivity, and ride programs can increase two wheel riders. This is important when trying to reduce vehicle traffic. Other modes of transportation should be available and supported by quality infrastructure.(De Angelis et al., 2021, p. 4
**Trip characteristics** - Trip length and duration are significant factors in mode choice, with long distances heavily impacting trip satisfaction. (De Angelis et al., 2021, pp. 6–7)

### Campus travel characteristics
#####  (Khattak et al., 2011)

Using survey method this study provides a comprehensive quantitative exploration of the unique travel behavior of university students.(p. 144) 
There is a lack peer-reviewed literature focused on HEI populations as a subgroup. Students as a subgroup have distinct characteristics and travel pattern compared to general population, especially in regard to **trip rate**.(138) Current planning approaches underestimate the impact of university transportation and a more rigorous assessment of traditional transportation planning is needed to capture the unique **travel behavior** and **trip generation** of university populations.(p.144)
They find that at the national level Students are underrepresented citing the 2029 National Household Travel Survey.(p.137) Students tend to live in dorms and may mobile number with no connection to a location being surveyed, making it more difficult to collect data on this subgroup.(p.137) 
To better understand this students travel behavior **Virginia Department of Transportation** conducted a internet-based survey of university students from the four main campuses, two in urban and two in *suburban areas*, in Virginia. Virginia Polytechnic Institution and State University(VT) being in suburban areas, and the University of Virginia(UVA), Virginia Commonwealth University(VCU), and Old Domain University(UDO) in *urban areas.*(p.137) Using a statistical analysis of survey results they examine *socioeconomic*, *demographic*, and *travel* *characteristics* of university students, ultimately establishing student population travel behavior differs significantly from the general public.(p.137)

#### Sociodemographic

This survey reflected the NHTS[^1] with eight sections: *personal characteristics, vehicle ownership, university commute, attitude toward walking and bicycling, working and parking information.*(p.139) Adjustments were made to better suit universities students. They transfer to on online trip dairy being a more feasible and efficient method of data collection, and including questions reguarding trip purpose, travel mode, and counted individual instead of households. (Khattak et al., 2011, p. 4) 

They tend live off-campus live with family or roommates, are younger and unmarried, have a lower income, have a drive license and a available vehicle, and live more active lifestyles.(p.139,144) In urban areas students situation were more similar to traditional household, maintaining and job and living with a family member.(p. 139) Most suburban students lived with roommates. Almost all students living off campus are full-time.(p.140)Majority the students trips are from school or work, making less trips to for recreational purposes.(p.144)  

#### Trips
To capture travel behavior they relied on trips, defining a **trip** as movement from one address to another longer than 300ft. This definition of trip is important distinction when assessing transportation of university students and traversing a university campus.
Student reguarding commute between on-campus buildings, that may include various modes of travel. Given the spatial span of university campus one could reasonably imagine various situations that would require driving, walking, or shuttling around campus.(p.140)

Survey results show most students make 20% more daily trips than the general public. Results find average daily trip frequency higher than the general public(3.69), landing between 4.4 and 4.9.(p.140)  Students make more trips during weekdays than compared to the weekend and trips from the general public's weekday trips.(p.140) Students living on-campus make the most trips.(p.141) This can be attributed to a younger average age, more active, lifestyle, and participation in recreational activities. Campus location and design promote active lifestyles for students by providing trip motivators including academic, recreation, dining, and shopping, *schools also provide programs.* Most students living off campus are full-time students living with roommates or family, suggesting whether a student is on or off campus with friends or family being associated with the university will increase their daily trips significantly.(p. 140) ==Student trips contributed by shopping is less than that of the general population, suggesting a significant portion of travel is directly or indirectly linked to the university.== 

#### Mode
Although almost all, 95%, of students have drivers license when compared to the general public, they generate less vehicle trips and are more likely to walk and bike.(p.141) Notably drive alone trips were higher at urban universities(UDO & VCU), accounting for over 40%. UVA had the higher rate of walking(1/3), likely attributed to students parking restrictions, campus walkability, accessibility and proximity of the campus design.(p.141) Universities(UVA, VT, VCU) with multiple transit options(school shuttle, regional transit) saw higher uses of transit. The difference for mode choice is more significant for student living on or off campus at urban campuses.(p.142)

#### Travel Pupose
The largest portion of trips are taken between home and university, accounting for 20-30% of all trips, travel between home and work place only accounting for 3-9%.(p. 142) Students have less trips from home to shop or recreate. The largest portion of trips were home, with the suburban campus having a higher percentage of students making trips of a academic nature(30%).(p.143) Urban campus had highest rate of trips to work(~8%), social and personal, and recreation.(p. 143) Virginia general population commute travel is unevenly spread throughout the day, with no significantly higher time. Students seems to have clear peak at noon and 6:00 p.m., with a preference to evening trips.(p.143) From what we know about trip purpose and trips origin it suggest the active nature of campus life, students are mostly likely making trips from campus where they are likely already engaged in other activities. 

###### 2021 North Carolina 
2021 Travel activity survey at North Carolina state university that students trips rates were significantly higher than the regional average of 4.06 trips per day. The results showed that on-campus undergraduate students generated the most daily trips **averaging more than six** trips per day.  They found most trips were directly or indirectly related to school with a high frequencies of trips related to food, social, and recreation. ==These survey results  suggest other universities and regions can benefit  better understanding university travel behavior.(p.138)==

HEI are significant regional trip generators and highlight the importance of collaborative transportation planning between the HEI and local municipals.

### Addressing Emissions - Trip Reduction

#### (Delmelle and Delmelle 2012)

The study explores the spatial and temporal travel behavior of University of Idaho student population. Moscow, Idaho is small compact town looking to decrease student vehicle dependency. 

They find that non-motorized modes are more feasible and  popular with student especially during better whether. However, if reducing overall car trips, it is necessary to disincentive driving(p.8). Based on student stated choices, doubling minimum parking pass would reduce car trips. Establishing that holding parking permit was found to be the most predictor of mode choice. Students holding the lowest level of parking used used multiple forms of transportation and were likely to not purchase a permit if prices were raised.

When attempting to shift travel behavior it is important to consider impacts on quality of life for surrounding areas/neighborhoods To ensure that surrounding neighborhoods are not negative impacted by changes  in university travel behavior,  it is necessary that transportation planning is a collaborative effort. Topography and safety as barrier to non-motorized modes.

#### Leveraging campus 
HEI can leverage their position to to promote broader institutional and community change. By better understanding attitudes, habits, and environmental factors, HEI have a opportunity to design infrastructure that encourage the use on active alternative transportation.
